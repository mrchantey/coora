# Boards

Naturally you'll need a development board to get started. We currently support the :rocket: **superstar** :rocket: ESP32-C3 board.



## Why ESP32-C3?

### Price
At one of the cheapest wifi enabled boards on the market, this chip is a great starting point

### Architecture
Unlike the ESP32, The ESP32-C3 uses the open [RISC-V](https://youtu.be/hF3sp-q3Zmk) architecture which is supported out of the box by our engine language, Rust. This makes the engine side of things far more approachable for devs.
